# *Worksace*

*We used VS Code to write this fucking site, so
and the extensions that will be described here will relate specifically to Code.*

*The second developer on our team wrote the code in Sublime Text 3 and also
sometimes we had to get into PhpStorm.
Over time, absolutely all extensions and utilities for work will appear, and
for now, only for Code.*

## *Extensions for VS Code:*
* *Auto Close Tag*
* *Auto Complete Tag*
* *Auto Rename Tag*
* *Beatify*
* *JavaScript (ES6) code snippets*
* *Live Server*
* *PHP IntelliSense*
* *Debugger for Chrome*
* *Debugger for Firefox*
* *HTML CSS Support*
* *SQLTools*
* *ESLint*
* *PHP Debug*
