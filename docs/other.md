# *Other*

*There are 2 folders in the other folder:*

* *drafts is a folder in which the drafts of the project are stored, which
refer to both backend and frontend. Any temporary work,
for which you do not need to create a separate fork - they are developed specifically
here.*

* *layouts - this folder stores layouts and design developments from Figma to
.fig and .png formats. It is this folder that is the repository of images and
developments of how the project should have looked at the design stage.*
